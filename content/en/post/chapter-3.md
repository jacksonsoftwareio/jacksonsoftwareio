Tonight we have released a minor update for JNote 1.0.  
Version 1.0.6971.40704.  
This update fixes a copy/paste bug and adds a right-click context menu to the JNote text area. The context menu contains simple copy/paste actions. We plan to extent the menu in the future with a dynamic range of items.
